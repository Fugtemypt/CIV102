# CIV102
CIV102 gives you an overview of civil and structural engineering and covers topics such as static systems, bending beams, truss bridge analysis, and concrete. Material is often introduced in its historical context, so you get both a technical understanding of the concepts and their societal relevance. Youâ€™re taught a set of equations and problem-solving techniques for each topic and are assessed with problems that ask you to apply these equations in new scenarios. The trick with this course is understanding how and where to apply your equations and rules, not necessarily how the equations and rules were derived.
